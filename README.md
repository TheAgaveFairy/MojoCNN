# MojoCNN
Working on converting this LeNet5 project to Mojo. Starting with a near 1:1 version just as a starting point, then I'll work on making it better with GPU kernels, SIMD, better data structures, etc.

https://github.com/fan-wenjie/LeNet-5 is the inspiration

The model_f64 is a trained version of the model saved from the C project in double format. I've also included a mnist csv just in case I want to play with that, but I'm using the binary files from the above project.
